# BucketList
An app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later

When you launch the app, a full-screen map appears on the screen. You can add map annotations by tapping on the + button. If you select an annotation, a sheet appears to edit the annotation details.

To use the app, you must unlock it with Face ID or Touch ID.

The app saves the annotation to a file on the device and reloads it when you launch the app.

Each annotation, when selected, shows nearby locations fetched from the Wikipedia API.
